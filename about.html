                    <h2>What is WOCE?</h2>
                        <p>To keep it short, WOCE is a platform for individuals of color to share their stories. We interview different individuals of color about their experiences in the workplace, school systems, and life in general.</p>
                        <br>
                    <h2>Why only individuals of color?</h2>
                        <p>As we can all see through platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, mainstream media fails to acknowledge or highlight the successes and acomplishments of individuals of color. Although we love seeing all these amazing non-POC people thrive, we believe that individuals of color like ourselves deserve to have time in the spotlight as well. Our team is made up of primarily individuals of color, and we all understand the struggles of not having our stories be heard.</p>
                        <br>
